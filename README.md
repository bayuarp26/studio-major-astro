## �️ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Preview production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## 🎯 Migration from Next.js

This project has been migrated from Next.js to Astro. Key changes include:

- **Pages**: Next.js pages converted to Astro pages in `src/pages/`
- **Components**: React components maintained with `client:` directives
- **Routing**: File-based routing (similar to Next.js but with `.astro` extensions)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS integration for consistent styling
- **Performance**: Static generation by default with selective hydration

## 🧩 Component Usage

### React Components with Hydration

```astro
---
import Button from '../components/Button.tsx';
---

<!-- Use client:load for immediate hydration -->
<Button client:load>Click me</Button>

<!-- Use client:idle for lazy hydration -->
<Button client:idle>Lazy button</Button>

<!-- Use client:visible for viewport-based hydration -->
<Button client:visible>Visible button</Button>
```

### Astro Components

```astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
---

<Layout title="My Page">
  <h1>Welcome to Astro!</h1>
</Layout>
```
